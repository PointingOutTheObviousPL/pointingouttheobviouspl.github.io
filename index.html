        <h3>What is POTO?</h3>
        <p>
            We are a group of high schoolers trying to make mental health accessible to all students. What's so obvious, you may ask? Two things: mental health in teenagers is a huge problem. Yet there are many resources to help that they're not using for a variety of reasons. 
            Making a simple Google search for mental health resources brings up a bunch of stuff, but which ones actually work? 
            We made a compiled list of organizations with brief descriptions so you can easily find help best suited for you. 
            Made by teens, for teens.
        </p>
        <h3>About us</h3>
        <p>
            Mental health is an obvious problem in teens, yet few of them know where to get help or just don't feel comfortable asking for help. 
            This is why we created POTO: to make quality mental health services more accessible! 
            We also created an app called POTOConnect that allows teens to talk to each other about sensitive topics anonymously without feeling nervous or embarrassed, as is so common with teens seeking mental help. 
            Our team came about from the Aspen Challenge program, which challenges high school students to create and implement a solution to one of 5 topics. 
            This year, 2024, PLHS chose to try and make mental health resources widely accessible to all students at no cost. 
            Our hope is that POTO and POTOConnect become reliable mental health hubs for teens to connect.
        </p>
        <h3>About our App (currently in beta)</h3>
        <p>
            Our App, POTOConnect, has chat rooms where teens seeking help can chat anonymously with therapists in training and other teens facing similar problems. 
            Getting access to licensed therapists can be difficult, costly, and some people feel burdensome when asking for help. 
            Our app solves all of these issues because it's super easy to access, it's free, and by participating you are actively training student therapists so they can later work professionally. 
            We are hoping for this app to become accessible on school computers in SDUSD, but for now we are beta-testing on IOS and Android.
